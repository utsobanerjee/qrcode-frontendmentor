## My process
- At first I wrote the HTML . We needed two containers , the inside container to hold the QR Code image and the two paragraphs and other one to hold the inside container . The outside container had to take the full screen of the desktop and the inside container to be placed in the middle of the outside container .
- After I got it done with my HTML , I created the style sheet and started to add styles to it according to the design files .
- One important thing to remember here to change the flex-direction of the inside container to column .
- You need to adjust the image size (height and width accordingly) to fit it inside the flex-container , otherwise the image with the texts will overflow and go beyond the container .

### Built with
- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

- I learned to center a single flex-item (also a flex-container itself) inside a full screen(desktop size flex-container) using height and width properties CSS .

- I learned how to use width: %px property to manipulate width of every flex-item in accordance to its parent container 


### Continued development

I will use this section to outline areas that I want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts I am still not completely comfortable with or techniques I found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
